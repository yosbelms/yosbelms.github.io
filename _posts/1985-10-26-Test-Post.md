**The Language of the Web**

Cor is an opensource language that compiles to regular JavaScript. It is designed to make easy to write simple, fast and maintainable software for the Web.

Cor is a new language that compiles line-to-line into the equivalent JavaScript. The resulting code runs at equal speed to handwritten JS. You can use any existing JavaScript library in Cor and vice-versa.


## Installation

Install globally from npm:
```
npm install -g cor-lang
```

Leave off the `-g` if you don't wish to install globally:
```
npm install cor-lang
```

Also you can install it with Bower:
```
bower install cor-lang
```
